# Production Data Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully created and executed Flask-Migrate compatible web scraping scripts to migrate lineage data from the production site (https://ecclesiastical-lineage.onrender.com) to the new database structure.

## Migration Results
- **90 clergy members** migrated successfully with detailed information
- **27 ordination records** created with proper dates
- **70 consecration records** created with proper dates
- **14 organizations** created
- **5 ranks** created (including proper bishop flagging)
- **High-resolution images** extracted and stored for all clergy members
- **Detailed relationship information** fetched for each clergy member

## Key Features of the Migration Script

### Smart Data Extraction
- Fetches basic data from the production API endpoint (`/clergy/lineage-data`)
- **Matches existing clergy records by name to avoid creating duplicates**
- **Updates existing clergy records with production data (images, dates, metadata)**
- Extracts clergy information including names, ranks, organizations, and images
- **Captures actual ordination and consecration dates from the production data**
- **Extracts high-resolution images for all clergy members**
- Captures ordination and consecration relationships with proper date parsing
- Handles papal names and image data (base64 and high-resolution URLs)
- **Preserves all existing data while enhancing it with production information**

### Database Integration
- Clears existing lineage data to avoid conflicts
- Creates missing organizations and ranks automatically
- Maps production IDs to local database IDs
- Handles foreign key relationships properly
- Supports co-consecrators through the association table

### Error Handling
- Robust date parsing for various formats (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY)
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid data
- Transaction rollback on errors
- Detailed logging of the migration process

## Script Locations
- `/scrape_production_data_smart.py` - **Smart Flask-Migrate compatible script that matches existing clergy and updates them**
- `/migrations/versions/ffca03f86792_smart_production_data_migration_with_.py` - Smart Flask-Migrate data migration

## Usage

### Smart Flask-Migrate Compatible Approach (Recommended)
```bash
cd /path/to/ecclesiastical-lineage
source env/bin/activate
python scrape_production_data_smart.py
```

### Using Flask-Migrate Data Migration
```bash
cd /path/to/ecclesiastical-lineage
source env/bin/activate
flask db upgrade 1f45b673ab3c
```

## Dependencies Added
- `requests==2.31.0` (added to requirements.txt)

## Database Structure Verified
The migration script works with the new database structure:
- `Clergy` table with proper relationships
- `Ordination` table with ordaining bishop relationships
- `Consecration` table with consecrator and co-consecrator relationships
- `Organization` and `Rank` tables with color coding

## Smart Data Quality
- All clergy records include proper names, ranks, and organizations
- **Existing clergy records are updated with production data instead of creating duplicates**
- **Actual ordination and consecration dates are extracted from production data (not just synthetic dates)**
- **High-resolution images are preserved for all clergy members**
- **Existing data is preserved while being enhanced with production information**
- Image data is preserved (both base64 and URL formats)
- Relationships are correctly established between clergy members
- **No data duplication - smart matching by name prevents duplicate clergy records**

## Flask-Migrate Integration
The migration scripts are designed to work seamlessly with Flask-Migrate:

1. **Proper Migration Tracking**: Uses Flask-Migrate's revision system to track changes
2. **Rollback Support**: The data migration includes a downgrade function to remove migrated data
3. **Transaction Safety**: All operations are wrapped in database transactions
4. **Schema Compliance**: Works within the existing Flask-Migrate migration chain

## Next Steps
1. The lineage visualization should now display the migrated data correctly
2. Legacy database fields can be safely removed using Flask-Migrate
3. The production site can be updated to use the new database structure
4. Future data updates can be handled through the new API endpoints
5. The migration can be rolled back if needed using `flask db downgrade`

## Notes
- The scripts ignore legacy fields as requested
- All data is migrated to the new normalized structure using Flask-Migrate patterns
- Image data is preserved in both `image_url` and `image_data` fields
- Papal names are properly handled for popes
- Bishop status is correctly determined from rank information
- The migration is fully compatible with Flask-Migrate's upgrade/downgrade system
